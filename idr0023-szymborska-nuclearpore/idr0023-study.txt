Study Description	Much of life's essential molecular machinery consists of large protein assemblies that currently pose challenges for structure determination. A prominent example is the nuclear pore complex (NPC), for which the organization of its individual components remains unknown. By combining stochastic super-resolution microscopy, to directly resolve the ringlike structure of the NPC, with single particle averaging, to use information from thousands of pores, we determined the average positions of fluorescent molecular labels in the NPC with a precision well below 1 nanometer. Applying this approach systematically to the largest building block of the NPC, the Nup107-160 subcomplex, we assessed the structure of the NPC scaffold. Thus, light microscopy can be used to study the molecular organization of large protein complexes in situ in whole cells.

Protocol Description	Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, according to standard protocols. Immunofluorescence was performed using an adapted protocol from Krull et al. (31). Briefly, the cells were grown overnight on 8-well Lab-Tek Chambered Coverglass (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were then rinsed with 2.4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS and extracted with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 3 min. Next, the cells were fixed for 30 min with 2.4% PFA in PBS, quenched for 5 min with 50 mM NH4Cl, then extensively washed with PBS, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Life Technologies) in PBS (blocking buffer) for 1 hour. Subsequently, the cells were incubated overnight at 4C with primary antibodies freshly diluted in the blocking buffer, and then with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. For experiments with GFP-tagged nucleoporins, U2OS cells were transected with the appropriate construct using Fugene 6 (Promega). 24 hours later the cells were transferred onto 24-well plate coated with a matching siRNA. After another 48 hours, the cells were split onto gridded cover slips (50 um grid spacing, IBIDI), which facilitated identification of cells with the appropriate expression levels of Nup-GFP. For imaging we were selecting cells with high level of incorporation of the tagged Nup into the pore, characterized by brightness and low cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic background, which did not exhibit pore clustering or aberrant nuclear shape phenotypes indicative of large over-expression of Nups. 16 hours later, the cells were extracted and fixed as described above. Next, the samples were incubated for 30 min with a few drops of Image-iT FX Signal Enhancer solution (Life Technologies) and then blocked for 1 hour with 5% BSA in PBS. Finally the samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-GFP nanobody diluted in 5% BSA/PBS for 90 min and then washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS. Differential permeabilization of the cells was achieved by 4 min incubation on ice with 33 ug/ml Digitonin in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 110mM CH3COOK, 5mM CH3COONa, 2 mM Mg(CH3COO)2 and 1mM EGTA, prior to fixation. The samples were then fixed and blocked as described above and stained with anti-GFP nanobody and 133A2-LaminA, detected with Alexa Fluor 546 conjugated secondary antibody. All samples were imaged immediately after preparation.	All SR imaging was performed on a Leica SR GSD microscope, equipped with a 500 mW 642 nm and 1000 mW 532 nm continuous wave lasers (MPBC, Inc.); a 30 mW 405 nm diode laser (Coherent, Inc.); a DBP 405/10 642/10 excitation filter; an MBP 405/488/561/635 excitation filter (used in double color experiments); an LP 649 and LP 541 dichroic mirror; a BP 710/100 and BP 600/100 suppression filters; Leica HCX PL APO 100x, NA 1.47 Oil CORR TIRF PIFOC objective; and an additional 1.6x magnification lens. The image was collected on an Andor iXon3 897 EMCCD camera, with a final optical pixel size of 100 nm. The lateral drift was minimized by the Suppressed Motion (SuMo) stage. The samples were embedded in GLOX-MEA imaging buffer (32), containing: glucose oxidase-based oxygen scavenging system (GLOX, 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 40 ug/ml catalase, 10% w/v glucose); 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM NaCl; and 10 mM B-Mercaptoethylamine (MEA, prepared from solid at 100 mM in PBS and adjusted with HCl to pH 7.4, stored at -20C). The buffer was prepared fresh and exchanged after approximately 90 minutes of imaging. In order to bring the fluorophores into dark states, the sample was first illuminated with 642 nm light at the maximum laser power, until single fluorophore blinking behavior was observed, typically for less than 30 s. Next, a long series was acquired at intermediate laser power, at a rate of 100 frames per second. To determine the minimal length of the series, which generates SR images of sufficient quality for single particle averaging, we reconstructed images of Nup133-FL-labled cells using a decreasing number of frames. We then averaged particles from these images and measured the average radial position of the Nup133-FL label (see: 'Iterative translational alignment' and 'Estimation of radial position and cross-validation analysis') and found that the measurement became stable above 20,000-40,000 frames. We therefore used only series with at least 40,000 frames for SR image reconstruction (Fig. S2A).  In order to facilitate the return of fluorophores to the ground state at a constant rate, the sample was illuminated with the 405 nm back-pumping laser; the gradual increase of the 405 nm laser intensity was achieved either manually or by the GSD Wizard's 'Auto Backpumping' feature. Imaging was performed in epifluorescence mode. For double color imaging, the cells were plated on Lab-Tek coverglass coated with 100 nm Tetraspeck microspheres (Life Technologies) which served as registration marks for the alignment of the two channels. We acquired the single fluorophore blinking series sequentially, starting with the 642 nm channel and then registered the datasets as described before (32). Our final registration error across the whole field of view was ~ 7 nm.	All image processing and computer simulations in this study, unless otherwise stated, were performed in Matlab 2010, (The Mathworks, Inc). Single fluorophore blinking events were localized with a fast centroid fit, implemented in the Leica SR GSD Wizard, using 25 photons per pixel as the detection threshold. The integrated intensity of an individual event was calculated as the number of photons collected after background subtraction, divided by the camera calibration factor determined by the manufacturer. To exclude events with low localization precision, those with an integrated intensity of less than 500 photons were filtered out.  The lateral drift in the images was corrected using an adapted correlation-based method (32, 33). Briefly, the localization data was split into equal segments of several thousand frames and an SR image was reconstructed from each segment. A correlation map between adjacent segments was calculated using the Kuglin-Hines algorithm (34). The position of the peak in the correlation map was determined by a 2D Gaussian fit and the relative shift was calculated as a difference between peak positions in subsequent maps. The final drift curves were generated by linear interpolation and then subtracted from the localization data. The procedure was iterated until no residual drift was observed. The final SR images were reconstructed from the intensity-filtered and drift- corrected sets of localizations using 10 nm pixelation. Each localization event was rendered as a single gray value of a 16-bit image.
