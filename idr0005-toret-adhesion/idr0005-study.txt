Study Title	A genome-wide screen identifies conserved protein hubs required for cadherin-mediated cellÐcell adhesion

Study Description	"Cadherins and associated catenins provide an important structural interface between neighboring cells, the actin cytoskeleton, and intracellular signaling pathways in a variety of cell types throughout the Metazoa. However, the full inventory of the proteins and pathways required for cadherin-mediated adhesion has not been established. To this end, we completed a genome-wide (_14,000 genes) ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) screen that targeted Ca2+-dependent adhesion in DE-cadherinÐexpressing Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells in suspension culture. This novel screen eliminated Ca2+-independent cellÐcell adhesion, integrin-based adhesion, cell spreading, and cell migration. We identified 17 interconnected regulatory hubs, based on protein functions and proteinÐprotein interactions that regulate the levels of the core cadherinÐcatenin complex and coordinate cadherin-mediated cellÐcell adhesion. Representative proteins from these hubs were analyzed further in Drosophila oogenesis, using targeted germline RNAi, and adhesion was analyzed in MadinÐDarby canine kidney mammalian epithelial cellÐcell adhesion. These experiments reveal roles for a diversity of cellular pathways that are required for cadherin function in Metazoa, including cytoskeleton organization, cellÐsubstrate interactions, and nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling."

Protocol Description	"Drosophila S2U cells were maintained in SchneiderÕs medium (Invitro- gen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma- Aldrich), penicillin, streptomycin, and kanamycin (Goshima et al., 2007). Full-length DE-cadherin was cloned into pAc5.1/V5ÐHis B (Invitrogen) and cotransfected with blasticidin and hygromycin plasmids in S2U cells to generate stable expression lines (Millar et al., 1994). For RNAi treatment, DE-cadherinÐexpressing S2 cells were treated with 625 _g/ml trypsin for 20 min at 25¡C and then resuspended in serum-free SchneiderÕs medium. 1 _g RNA was incubated with 6 _ 105 cells for 30 min in serum-free SchneiderÕs medium followed by a 5-d recovery in SchneiderÕs medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Goshima et al., 2007). RNAi-treated cells were maintained in plasticware coated with a 10% Pluronic 127 (Sigma-Aldrich) solution to minimize cellÐsubstrate interactions. After 5 d of RNAi treatment, 1 _g/ml Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Sci- entific) was added to each well. 96-well plates were shaken for 5 min at 800 rpm on a vortex mixer (MixMate; Eppendorf). 96-well plates were then placed on a platform that rotated around a 3-cm radius (D. Proffit, Molecular and Cellular PhysiologyÐStanford Institute for Neuro-Innovation and Translational Neuroscience Engineering Shop, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) for 20 min at 250 rpm and were next shaken for 30 s at 650 rpm on a MixMate."	"The initial genome-wide screen used the V2 RNAi library (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Goshima et al., 2007)."	Plates were imaged using an automated microscope (ImageXpress Micro; Molecular Devices) with a 4_ objective. Images were acquired with MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) and a camera (CoolSNAP HQ; Photometrics). 	"For scoring, three images/well were ranked by eye based on aggregation (0 = strong aggregation; 4 = no ag- gregation). A score of >1.5 was considered defective aggregation.
