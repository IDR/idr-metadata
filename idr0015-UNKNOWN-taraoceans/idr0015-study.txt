Study Title	Quantitative 3D-imaging for cell biology and ecology of environmental microbial eukaryotes				
Study Type	high content screen				
Study Type Term Source REF	EFO				
Study Type Term Accession	EFO_0007550				
Study Description	We present a 3D-fluorescence imaging and classification tool for high throughput analysis of microbial eukaryotes in environmental samples. It entails high-content feature extraction that permits accurate automated taxonomic classification and quantitative data about organism ultrastructures and interactions. Using plankton samples from the Tara Oceans expeditions, we validate its applicability to taxonomic profiling and ecosystem analyses, and discuss its potential for future integration of eukaryotic cell biology into evolutionary and ecological studies.

Comment[IDR Screen Name]	idr0015-colin-taraoceans/screenA	
Screen Sample Type	cell
Screen Description	eHCFM: a 3D-fluorescence imaging and classification tool for high throughput analysis of microbial eukaryotes in environmental samples. The method generates for each given sample a mosaic of multi-dimentional fields of view (3D, 5 channels). We propose here the exploration of raw images of plankton samples from the Tara Oceans expeditions.
