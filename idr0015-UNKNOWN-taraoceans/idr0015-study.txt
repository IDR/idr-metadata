Study Description	"Protists are responsible for much of the diversity in the eukaryotic kingdom and are crucial to several biogeochemical processes of global importance (e.g., the carbon cycle). Recent global investigations of these organisms have relied on sequence-based approaches. These methods do not, however, capture the complex functional morphology of these organisms nor can they typically capture phenomena such as interactions (except indirectly through statistical means).  Direct imaging of these organisms, can therefore provide a valuable complement to sequencing and, when performed quantitatively, provide measures of structures and interaction patterns which can then be related back to sequence based measurements. Towards this end, we developed a framework, environmental high-content fluorescence microscopy (e-HCFM) which can be applied to environmental samples composed of mixed communities. This strategy is based on general purposes dyes that stain major structures in eukaryotes. Samples are imaged using scanning confocal microscopy, resulting in a three-dimensional image-stack. High-throughput can be achieved using automated microscopy and computational analysis."

Protocol Description	"The environmental samples used in this study were collected along the the Tara-Oceans. At each station an identical sampling protocol was used to collect and to preserve protist organisms in the size range between 5 and 20µm from subsurface and/or deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) depth. In particular, a dedicated net with a 5µm mesh size was gently towed for ten minutes to help preserve plankton morphology and to avoid net saturation. A flowmeter located in the entrance of the net allowed quantification of the filtered water volume. The cod-end sample was then carefully recovered and poured through a 20µm sieve to remove the larger organisms. The filtrate was resuspended with 0.2µm filtered seawater up to 3L. A total of 45 ml was then poured into a 50ml tube that was prealiquoted with 5 ml of 10% paraformaldehyde buffered at pH7.5 and 500μl of 25% glutaraldehyde (EM grade) 14,15 . The collecting tubes were stored at -20°C prior to use, and after gentle homogenization, the samples were kept at 4°C.  Samples were fluorescently dyed using Alexa Fluor® 546 succinimidyl ester (AF546SE)    (Molecular Probes®, A-20002) conjugated to poly-L-lysine (PLL), followed b  a solution of Hoechst33342 (Molecular Probes®, H21492) at 10µM (stock solution 1mM/H2O) and DiOC6(3) (Molecular Probes®, D-273) at 1.5µM (stock solution 1.5mM/EtOH) in ESAW (500µl/30mn). Microscopy was conducted using a commercially available inverted SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystem) equipped with a HC PL APO 40x/1,10 l mot CORR CS2 lens and the following laser beam lines: 405nm, 488nm, 552nm, 638nm.  A two-step sequential acquisition was designed to collect the signal from 5 channels. The first step aims to record DiOC6(3) signal (Ex488nm/Em500-520nm) simultaneously with the chlorophyll autofluorescence signal (Ex633nm/Em675-710nm), and the transmitted light channel. The second step is then dedicated to acquisition of the Hoechst signal (Ex405nm/Em420-470nm) and the AF546 signal (Ex561/Em575-600). The exposure settings were tuned to avoid signal saturation of the brightest object of interest, and to use minimal power of the laser allowing a PMT gain lower than 800mv. Signals were not averaged. The scanning speed was set at 600 Hz, with each field of view (FOV) at 388µm wide and a pixel size of 0.189µm."
