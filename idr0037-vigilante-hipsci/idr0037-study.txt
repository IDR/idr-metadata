Comment[IDR Screen Name]	idr0037-vigilante-hipsci/screenA						
Screen Description	"Cellular phenotyping of 87 human induced pluripotent stem cell lines from 62 donors within the framework of the HipSci project. Cells are plated sparsely, 3000 per 96 well for 24 hours on wells coated with three diverse concentrations of Fibronectin. 29 of the plates are also found in idr0034 but with images from different cell lines shown."
