Study Description	"We have developed a platform for validation of antibody binding and protein subcellular localization data obtained from immunofluorescence using siRNA technology combined with automated confocal microscopy and image analysis. By combining the siRNA technology with automated sample preparation, automated imaging and quantitative image analysis, a high-throughput assay has been set-up to enable confirmation of accurate protein binding and localization in a systematic manner. Here, we describe the analysis and validation of the subcellular location of 65 human proteins, targeted by 75 antibodies and silenced by 130 siRNAs. A large fraction of (80%) the subcellular locations, including locations of several previously uncharacterized proteins, could be confirmed by the significant down-regulation of the antibody signal after the siRNA silencing. A quantitative analysis was set-up using automated image analysis to facilitate studies of targets found in more than one compartment. The results obtained using the platform demonstrate that siRNA silencing in combination with quantitative image analysis of antibody signals in different compartments of the cells is an attractive approach for ensuring accurate protein localization as well as antibody binding using immunofluorescence. With a large fraction of the human proteome still unexplored, we suggest this approach to be of great importance under the continued work of mapping the human proteome on a subcellular level."

Protocol Description	"The U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cell line (ATCC-LGC Pro- mochem, Bora_s, Sweden) was used throughout this study. The cells were grown in 37 ¡C with 5% CO2 humidified envi- ronment in McCoys growth media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as recommended by the provider.  At the day before transfection, cells were split 1:3 from a 90% confluent plate to maintain log-phase growth (approx- imately 60% confluence) upon seeding onto the transfection plates the next day. Transfection was carried out in the pre- viously prepared siRNA coated 96-well plates and when seeding cells into the transfection plates, the growth media were changed from McCoys to DMEM still supple- mented with 10% FBS. 2000 cells were seeded in each well and grown for 72h before fixation. All cell cultivation media and supplements were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich (GmbH, Steinheim Germany)."	"Cell fixation, permeabilization and immunostaining were performed according to our standard protocol optimized and described in earlier studies ([2,20]) and briefly described below, using a Tecan Evo Freedom pipetting robot (Tecan, Ma_nnedorf, Switzerland). Cells were washed with phos- phate buffered saline, PBS (8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) prior to fixation for 15 min with 4% ice-cold paraformaldehyde (PFA) (VWR, West Chester, Pennsylvania, US) in cell growth media supplemented with 10% FBS. Permeabilization of the cells was performed using 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 3 _ 5 min. The antibodies anti-calreticulin (Abcam ab14234 Ñ only used for normal variation study) and anti-tubulin (Abcam, ab7291) were diluted to 1 _g/mL and the Human Protein Atlas antibodies diluted to 2 _g/mL, all in blocking buffer (1xPBS with 4% FBS) were added and incubated over night at 4 ¡C. Cells were then washed 4 _ 10 min with PBS and secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488, goat anti-mouse Alexa 555 and goat anti-chicken Alexa 647 Ñ all from Invitrogen) diluted to 1 _g/ml in blocking buffer was added for 1,5 h at RT followed by subsequent staining with the nuclear probe 4_, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole,  DAPI (Invitrogen) diluted to 300 nM in 1xPBS for 5 min be- fore additional washing with 1xPBS for 4 _ 10 min. Finally the wells were filled with PBS containing 78% glycerol be- fore the plate was sealed."	"A solid-phase transfection protocol developed by H. Erfle et al., was used in this study [18,19]. All preparations were per- formed using a Liquidator pipetting station (Steinbrenner Labor Systems, GMBH, Germany) and Silencer Select siRNAs from Ambion (Austin, Texas, USA). The siRNA transfection mix for each target specific siRNA was prepared by mixing 1.75 _l Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 1.75 _l H2O. Sub- sequently 3.5 _l sucrose/Opti-MEM solution (13.7% (w/v)) was added, followed by 5 _l silencer-select siRNA (3 _M). The solution was gently mixed and incubated 20 min at RT before 7 _l of a 0.2% gelatine solution was added to obtain a total volume of 19 _l of each siRNA transfection mix. 16 _l of siRNA transfection mix was then stepwise diluted into 800 _l H2O and immediately after, 50 _l (siRNA concentration 13 nM) was transferred into the designated well of the 96 well-plates. A desired number of plates (up to 16 replicates) were produced simultaneously. Plates were dried in a speed-vac for 45 min at 50 ¡C, 30 min at 49Ð41 ¡C followed by 20 min at 37 ¡C. The lyophilization progression was checked during the run between the temperature gradient changes. After complete lyophilization, plates were stored with drying pearls in sealed boxes at RT for future use. For each of the 65 genes included in this study, two different gene-specific siRNAs, targeting different sequences of the target mRNA, were coated and lyophilized into separate wells in 96-well plates as described above (Supplementary Table 1). For all genes, a scrambled siRNA sequence was used as a negative control. The siRNA (Silencer Select) used were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Only sequences with 100% homology to the target gene, unique targeting in the genome and targeting of all or most transcripts of the target gene were used. All siRNAs were designed with a LNA (locked nucleic acids) modification on the sense strand. Supplementary Table 1 shows the sequences mapped to Ensembl version 61. To ensure the quality of the sample preparation and antibody staining pattern, a well without any siRNA was used as reference However, this well was not part of the quantification and thus evaluation of the tar- get specific siRNAs but only as a control before imaging and further analysis of the scrambled and target siRNA specific wells. This design enabled 24 genes to be fitted onto one 96-well plate and to cover all 65 genes three different plates were designed and produced in replicate batches. "	"To facilitate a high-throughput procedure and objective and reproducible imaging, the confocal image acquisition was automated using a Leica SP5 laser-scanning confocal micro- scope and the Leica Matrix Screener v.2.3.0 software (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). A 10 _/0.3 N/A dry objec- tive was used for single organelle staining antibodies and to facilitate proper annotation, higher magnification using a 40_/0.85 N/A dry objective for the multiple organelle staining antibodies. Both objectives were used with the following scan- ning settings; 8 bit acquisition, 600 Hz scan speed, line average 2 and a image size of 2048_2048 pixels. The pixel size was 0.75 _ 0.75 _m and 0.19 _ 0.19 _m for the 10 _ and 40 _ objective. To capture enough cells (n > 20) for the subsequent quantitative analysis, images were acquired at 4 or 16 non-overlapping positions in each well for the 10 _ and 40 _ ob- jective, respectively. With this set-up, 48 or 192 images were ac- quired for each antibody. For each position, a low-resolution (16 _ 16 pixels) autofo- cus procedure based on contrast from the microtubule anti- body staining (contrast based method 1 in Leica Matrix Screener v.2.3.0) was applied using the 543 nm HeNe laser. Following this, a sequential acquisition of the three fluoro- phores was used to avoid cross talk with the following set- up: a UV 405 nm diode laser for excitation of the DAPI staining of the nucleus, a 543 nm and 633 nm HeNe laser for excitation of the Alexa 555 and Alexa 647 secondary antibodies staining the microtubules (_-tubulin) and calreticulin in the endoplas- mic reticulum (the latter used for normal variation study only), and a 488nm argon laser exciting the Alexa 488 secondary antibody for detection of the target protein. Before starting the automated acquisition, the detector gain was manually adjusted for each antibody using the staining of the negative control. To make best use of the dynamic range of the detector and to trace any potential decrease in staining intensity between the wells, the gain was adjusted to mini- mize the number of saturated pixels and use the full dynamic range of the detector. To allow quantitative relative measure- ments of staining intensity, the two siRNA samples and the control were always imaged with identical gain settings. To better visualize the degree of down-regulation as a result from quantitative imaging, a selected subset of antibodies were imaged manually at higher resolution using a 63_/ 1.4 N/A oil immersion objective, with the same parameters as for the automated set-up. The pixel size here was 80_80nm."	"	The image analysis software Cell Profiler [21] was used for quantitative and automated measurements of the fluorescence from the antibodies. To prevent misleading results caused by background staining, segmentation masks using the fluores- cent staining of the cells, nuclei and cytoplasm, was applied prior to quantitative fluorescence measurements (Fig. 1). The segmentation module was set-up using the predefined algo- rithms available within Cell profiler [21] using the DAPI staining for identification of primary objects (the nuclei), with a size threshold of 30Ð100 and 150Ð400 pixels in diameter for 10_ and 40_ images respectively. Secondary objects were identified around the primary objects using the microtubule staining and a propagation algorithm to define cell borders. The overlay of the nucleus- and cell mask was used to generate the cytoplasm mask. The in-build Otsu global algorithm was used to set inten- sity cut-offs for primary as well as secondary objects. The quantitative analysis was performed within different segment- ed objects depending on the complexity of the antibody stain- ing. For antibodies staining a single organelle, analysis was done within the entire cell only, whereas independent quanti- fication of the fluorescence in the nucleus and cytoplasm was performed for antibodies staining multiple organelles, to com- pare decreases in the compartments separately an thus be able to explore potential cross reactivity. For each object, the in- tegrated fluorescence intensity (IFI) from the HPA antibody was measured and normalized to the IFI of the common microtu- bule antibody to enable comparison between different samples. The median integrated fluorescence intensity (IFI) for each sample (siRNA and negative control) was calculated. This allowed for comparison of samples, while reducing the impact of staining artifacts and outliers on both pixel and cell level. To quantify the degree of siRNA efficacy and protein down- regulation in the siRNA well, the median IFI was compared to the negative control to obtain the relative fluorescence intensi- ty (RFI) between 0 and 100% where 100% indicate no decrease and 0% indicate complete disappearance of the signal. For visu- alization of the results the distribution of RFI for the cells in a sample was presented in a box-plot and the significance of the down-regulation was evaluated using a Mann Whitney test. This procedure was automated by an in-house developed Laboratory Information Management System to allow rapid as- sessment of the results."
