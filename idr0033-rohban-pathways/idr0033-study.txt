Study Description	"We hypothesized that human genes and disease-associated alleles might be systematically functionally annotated using morphological profiling of cDNA constructs, via a microscopy-based Cell Painting assay. Indeed, 50% of the 220 tested genes yielded detectable morphological profiles, which grouped into biologically meaningful gene clusters consistent with known functional annotation (e.g., the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade). We used novel subpopulation-based visualization methods to interpret the morphological changes for specific clusters. This unbiased morphologic map of gene function revealed TRAF2/c-REL negative regulation of YAP1/WWTR1-responsive pathways. We confirmed this discovery of functional connectivity between the NF-kB pathway and Hippo pathway effectors at the transcriptional level, thereby expanding knowledge of these two signaling pathways that critically regulate tumor initiation and progression. We make the images and raw data publicly available, providing an initial morphological map of major biological pathways for future study."

Protocol Description	250 cells (from U2OS cell line) are plated per well in 384 plates.	Cells were plated in 384 well plates and transduced with lentiviral particles carrying ORF constructs the next day. Viral particles were removed 18-24 hr post-infection and cells cultured for 48 hr until staining and imaging (72 hr total post-transduction).	"The gene/alleles in the library are called Target Accelerator Reference set which mainly included oncogenes in various cell signaling pathways. This is described in more detail in Kim, Eejung, et al. 2016. Systematic Functional Interrogation of Rare Cancer Variants Identifies Oncogenic Alleles. Cancer Discovery 6 (7): 714-26. doi:10.1158/2159-8290.CD-16-0160."	Cell Painting imaging assay (Bray et al 2016) is used to capture cell morphology.	The cells were segmented and quantified in the CellProfiler open source software. Median of pairwise replicate correlations is used to identify overexpressed genes with a morphological phenotype.
