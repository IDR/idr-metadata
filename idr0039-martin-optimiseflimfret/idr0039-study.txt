Study Description	"FRET biosensors have proven very useful tools for studying the activation of specific signalling pathways in living cells. Most biosensors designed to date have been predicated on fluorescent protein pairs that were identified by, and for use in, intensity based measurements, however fluorescence lifetime provides a more reliable measurement of FRET. Both the technology and fluorescent proteins available for FRET have moved on dramatically in the last decade. Lifetime imaging systems have become increasingly accessible and user-friendly, and there is an entire field of biology dedicated to refining and adapting different characteristics of existing and novel fluorescent proteins. This growing pool of fluorescent proteins includes the long-lifetime green and cyan fluorescent proteins Clover and mTurquoise2, the red variant mRuby2, and the dark acceptor sREACh. Here, we have tested these donors and acceptors in appropriate combinations against the standard or recommended norms (EGFP and mTFP as donors, mCherry and either Ypet or Venus as acceptors) to determine if they could provide more reliable, reproducible and quantifiable FLIM-FRET data to improve on the dynamic range compared to other donors and breadth of application of biosensor technologies. These tests were performed for comparison on both a wide-field, frequency domain system and a multiphoton, TCSPC time domain FLIM system. Clover proved to be an excellent donor with extended dynamic range in combination with mCherry on both platforms, while mRuby2 showed a high degree of variability and poor FRET efficiencies in all cases. mTFP-Venus was the most consistent cyan-yellow pair between the two FLIM methodologies, but mTurquoise2 has better dynamic range and transfers energy consistently over time to the dark acceptor sRCh. Combination of mTFP- sRCh with Clover-mCherry would allow the simultaneous use of two FLIM-FRET biosensors within one sample by eliminating the crosstalk between the yellow acceptor and green donor emissions."

Protocol Description	"FRET donor proteins, FRET-pair fusions, and biosensors were expressed in HEK293 cellscultured as standard in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 2mM glutamine, 100U/mL penicillin and 100ug/mL streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer instructions. Cells to be stimulated were serum starved over night."	"The mammalian expression vectors used for single donor fluorescent proteins are summarised in Table S4. Donor-acceptor fusion proteins were based upon the Clontech pEGFP-C2 vector, which was cut at the HindIII and XbaI sites. The plasmid resulting from the insertion of a HindII/XbaI flanked mTq2 sequence into this site (creating a 21 amino acid spacer between the fluorescent proteins) was the digested with BamHI and BglII and religated to shorten the linker. The BamHI site was reintroduced, while also correcting the frameshift effect of the blunting and religation, using site directed mutagenesis (QuickChange Lightning, Agilent). This resulted in a vector with an amino acid spacer (SGRTQDPPVAT) between two fluorescent proteins. Donor and acceptor fluorescent sequences were switched using standard molecular cloning techniques, with donors inserted between the NheI/BamHI sites and acceptors between the BamHI/XbaI sites. The primers, designed to maintain the 11amino acid linker between constructs, and the template plasmids used, are detailed in Table S5. The GFP-RFP-RhoA biosensor was previously described [43], and the mTq2-sRCh-NRas biosensor was derived from this, using using standard molecular biology techniques to switch the fluorophore for those detailed above and BRaf-RBD and N-Ras sequences synthesised to order by Genewiz. The mTq2-sRCh-RalB biosensor was a modified form of that previously published by Der et al [46], with the fluorophores swapped out using standard molecular biology techniques and the Sec5 binding domain replaced by the RLIP76 (Ralbp1) binding domain sequence, also synthesised to order by Genewiz."	"Multiphoton time domain lifetime images were acquired at 20X magnification on a LaVision BioTec TRIMScope, which functions with a temporal bin size of 80ps, according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Time courses were performed by the operator initiating a scan every minute for 10 minutes. Time courses in which refocussing was required were discounted. The TCSPC data files were exported from the La Vision ImSpector Software and lifetime information from individual cells was extracted by fitting the decays from selected areas in the FLIMfit software tool (version 4.7.3) developed at Imperial College London, which has more sophisticated fitting protocols and allows for the fitting of bi-exponential models should it be necessary."	"Calculation of Expected FRET Efficiencies The Overlap Integral (J) of the donor emission and acceptor excitation spectra for each pair was calculated using the freeware program a|e - UV-Vis-IR Spectral Software 1.2 (http://www.fluortools.com/software/ae). The sources of each spectral dataset are detailed in the Supplementary Information. The Forster Radius (r0) for the pair was then calculated according to the equation below [47], in which we follow the convention of assuming the interdipole orientation factor,  kappa 2, to be 2/3[47] and using n=1.4 as the refractive index of cells in culture [48]. _0 = 0.02108(kappa 2 phi _ __4_)1/6. The other parameters in the equation are  D, the quantum yield of the donor, and the overlap integral, J, as calculated above. This equation gives r0 for the pair – the separation distance at which 50% FRET would be expected between the fluorophores. Expected FRET efficiencies can then be calculated for any given separation distance r (in nm) using the following equation [47]: _= _06/_06 + r6 . Data Handling. Lifetime measurements were made from between 10 and 20 cells per dish, with no more than 3 repeats being performed per day up to a total of 9 dishes per fluorophore pair. All FRET efficiencies were calculated relative to donor alone measurements made in the same cell type, on the same day. For Z-factor calculations the mean and standard deviation of the lifetimes measured for a pair and its donor alone control in one day were taken, with each day of experimentation considered one repeat (n=3)."
