Study Description	To investigate the DNA damage response, we undertook a genome-wide study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified 86 gene deletions that lead to increased levels of spontaneous Rad52 foci in proliferating diploid cells. More than half of the genes are conserved across species ranging from yeast to humans. Along with genes involved in DNA replication, repair, and chromatin remodeling, we found 22 previously uncharacterized open reading frames. Analysis of recombination rates and synthetic genetic interactions with rad52Delta suggests that multiple mechanisms are responsible for elevated levels of spontaneous Rad52 foci, including increased production of recombinogenic lesions, sister chromatid recombination defects, and improper focus assembly/disassembly. Our cell biological approach demonstrates the diversity of processes that converge on homologous recombination, protect against spontaneous DNA damage, and facilitate efficient repair.

Protocol Description	Individual deletions of nonessential genes made in the BY4742 and BY4739 MAT_ strains were obtained from the Saccharomyces Gene Deletion Project [64]. The conditional chromosome strains used to create the hybrid LOH strains and the method of inducing LOH in these strains have been described [12].Strain BY4742 was used as the wild-type control for the library background. Gene deletions from the library were backcrossed into the W303 background to create congenic strains. 	Examination of Rad52-YFP focus levels by microscopy was performed as previously described [66]. Briefly, cells were grown overnight in SC-Leu media at 23 C and exponentially growing cultures were prepared for microscopy. A single DIC image and 11 YFP images obtained at 0.3-_m intervals along the z-axis were captured for each frame, and Rad52-YFP foci were counted by inspecting all focal planes intersecting each cell. For each gene deletion strain in the screen, 200-400 cells were scored for Rad52-YFP foci.	n the focus screen described, 108 mutants were initially identified with Rad52-YFP foci in greater than 20% of cells examined. Of these 108, 80 gene deletions maintained the focus phenotype following repeat experiments and were selected for further analysis. After retesting all uncharacterized ORFs with focus levels between 15%-20% (41), nine consistently exhibited elevated foci and were added to the set of deletions. Three hypothetical ORFs were removed from the set after expression of the wild-type gene failed to complement the focus phenotype in the gene deletion strain. The remaining 86 gene deletions were prepared for the additional assays.
