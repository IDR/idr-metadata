Study Description	Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has enormous potential to provide improved cellular models of human disease. However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterisation of many existing iPSC lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here, we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 522 open access human iPSCs derived from 189 healthy male and female individuals as part of the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci: http://www.hipsci.org). Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability for use in genetic studies of complex human traits and cancer. Using a combination of genome- wide analyses we find that 5-25% of the variation in different iPSC phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. We also assess the phenotypic effects of rare, genomic copy number mutations that are recurrently seen following iPSC reprogramming and present an initial map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of pluripotent cells in humans.

Comment[IDR Screen Name]	idr0034-kilpinen-hipsci/screenA						
Screen Description	Cellular phenotyping of 28 human induced pluripotent stem cell lines from 14 donors within the framework of the HipSci project. Cells are plated sparsely, 3000 per 96 well for 24 hours on wells coated with three diverse concentrations of Fibronectin. Note the images relating to the publication 'Common genetic variation drives molecular heterogeneity in human iPSCs' have been released at this time (May 2017). An extended dataset in comparable conditions is due to be released in the future alongside associated studies.

Protocol Description	Each line was cultured and plated as previously described 17. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with three concentrations of Fibronectin in alternated columns in a randomised fashion. Cell lines were seeded also in rows in a randomised fashion. 3000 cells were plated and fixed after 24 hours. EdU was incorporated 30 minutes before fixation.	 Plates were then fixed and stained with DAPI and cell mask and EdU staining. Images were acquired using the Operetta (Perkin Elmer) high content device.	Using the Harmony software, measurements were derived for each cell. Measurements included intensity features (DAPI, EdU), morphology features (cell area, cell roundness, cell width to length ratio, nucleus area, nucleus roundness, nucleus width to length ratio) and context features related with cell adhesion properties (number of cells per clump). Quantification and normalization of data was performed as previously described Leha, A. et al. A high-content platform to characterise human induced pluripotent stem cell lines. Methods 96, 85-96, (2016).
