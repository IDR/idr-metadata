Study Description	We have adapted the mouse kidney rudiment assay to generate renal organoids. We have immunostained endpoint fixed organoids and E13.5 embryonic kidneys and imaged them with a light sheet fluorescent microscope. The data generated for this manuscript is made accessible here and includes immunofluorescence staining after end point fixation revealing that organotypic structures develop within the organoids. Furthermore, we have performed an assay to ascertain tubular functionality. Following, we have imaged organoids containing Wt1-GFP knock-in cells live on the light sheet microscope to evaluate the ability to follow cells long-term and generate previously unavailable quantitative tracking data.\n\nidr0038 consists of a set of 3 experiments: experimentA (immunofluorescence staining after end point fixation), experimentB (assays to ascertain tubular functionality) and experimentC (Wt1-GFP knock-in cells followed long term).

Experiment Description	We have adapted the mouse kidney rudiment assay to generate renal organoids. To demonstrate that the organoid culture method of re-aggregated kidney rudiments in PDMS discs resulted in 3D kidney organoids with organotypic structures, we stained fixed six day old organoids for various developmental markers and imaged them with a light sheet fluorescent microscope. We have stained for the following markers: Megalin, Laminin, Cytokeratin, Pax2, Six2, Wt1, Synaptopodin and Nephrin and have also used the lectin stain PNA (peanut agglutinin). The spheroids were usually imaged as z stacks from five angles.

Protocol Description	"Kidneys were isolated from E13.5 embryos after humane sacrifice of mice. For the initial experiments, wild type pregnant CD1 mice (Charles River, Margate, UK) were used. Alternatively, Wt1+/GFP (Wt1tm1Nhsn, following Wt1-GFP) male mice were crossed to wild-type CD1 female mice. Experimental animal protocols were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines under a licence granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and approved by the University of Liverpool Animal Ethics Committee. Intact rudiments were fixed immediately after isolation. The embryonic rudiments were processed using an established protocol. Briefly, they were pooled, washed 3 times with PBS and dissociated in 3 ml of 1_ trypsin in PBS at 37oC for five minutes. Every two minutes, the fragments of the rudiments were gently pipetted up and down to assure complete cellular dissociation of the tissue. The fragments/cells were stabilised with 10 ml DMEM + 10% FCS at 37oC for five minutes, and centrifuged to obtain a pellet. The re-suspended pellet was then counted by Trypan blue exclusion using a TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA), presenting with an average cell viability of 77% (wild type) and 69% (Wt1-GFP). For each assay, 1_105 cells were dispensed in 500 ul Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for two minutes. Each pellet was carefully detached from the tube wall and placed into a PDMS organoid well where the organoids compacted overnight. The organoids were cultured in this setup in a humidified incubator at 37oC and 5% CO2 for up to six days. Medium was removed from the incubated samples and organoids were washed with PBS followed by fixation with 4% Paraformaldehyde for 30 mins at room temperature and three PBS washes. "	"The clearing protocol chosen for this study is based on the CLARITY method, involving the embedding of the tissue in an acrylamide-based hydrogel followed by the removal of the main scattering components, i.e. lipids. The removal of the lipids also enables a deeper penetration of immunostaining agents, ultimately resulting in optically cleared tissue whilst maintaining structural information. Hydrogel Preparation: The embedding hydrogel was prepared according to an established protocol. The materials used to make up 40 ml of the final monomer solution are the following: 4.7 ml of Acrylamide/Bis (30%, 37.5:1), 100.5mg of VA-044 Initiator (2,2'-Azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane]dihydrochloride, Alphalabs 017-19362, final concentration 0.25%), 4 ml of 10_ PBS (final concentration 1_) and 10 ml of 16% PFA (final concentration 4%) in 21 ml ddH2O. The individual components were kept on ice during mixing to avoid polymerisation. The final solution was stored at -20oC until needed.  Hydrogel sample embedding: Hydrogel monomer aliquots were thawed at 4oC or on ice and then gently mixed to disperse any precipitate. The sample was introduced into the hydrogel monomer solution and kept on ice. They were incubated on a rocker over night at 4oC for hydrogel infusion. Prior to polymerisation, a layer of peanut oil was added on top of the aliquots and polymerisation was initiated and completed by keeping the samples at 37oC for 3 hours in a heating block. Following polymerisation, the peanut oil was discarded and excess hydrogel was removed from the samples using dissection tools, followed by washing 3_ with PBS and storage at 4oC until needed. Lipid Removal: The final clearing solution was prepared by dissolving 3.2 g of SDS in 40 ml of ddH2O under agitation and stored at room temperature. The samples were cleared through passive clearing by immersing the samples in the clearing solution and incubating them at 37oC for 48 hours. Finally, the samples were washed 3_ with PBST (0.1% Tween in PBS) for 10 mins to remove remaining SDS micelles. The cleared samples were stored in PBST at 4oC until needed. "	"Samples, some cleared and some un-cleared, were blocked for two hours at room temperature in blocking buffer (10% goat serum with 0.1% TritonX in PBS). The samples were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 4o. Secondary antibodies were diluted at a concentration of 1:1000 in blocking buffer and incubated for two hours at room temperature prior to staining with 30ug/ml rhodamine labeled Peanut Agglutinin (PNA, Vector Laboratories, USA) for 30 mins. The secondary antibodies used were: Alexa FluorTM 405 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), Alexa FluorTM 633 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG1, Alexa FluorTM 488 Goat Anti-mouse Invitrogen (Fisher Scientific).Fixed and stained samples were embedded into 1.5% agarose columns using appropriately sized glass capillaries. The glass capillaries were inserted into the imaging chamber of the microscope and the agarose column was extruded into the chamber filled with PBS. The light sheet fluorescence microscope used was a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope, fitted with 10_ illumination objectives and an achromatic 20_ detection objective. The laser wavelengths used were 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, 638 nm and the laser intensity was kept to a minimum. Green fluorescent beads, 30 nm small beads (Polystyrene latex beads (470/505), Sigma-Aldrich Corp., USA) or 1 um large beads (Fluospheres (505/515), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA), were used as fiduciary markers.

Experiment Description	All assays were performed on live cultures. The intact kidney rudiments were cultured at air liquid interface for 4 days following dissection. The organoids were cultured under medium immersion for six days following dissection. The samples cultured at air liquid interface were gently removed from the membranes before starting the assay. The samples were incubated for one hour at 25oC with PBS containing 1uM 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein (6-CF) and 20 ug/ml of PNA (Vector Laboratories). For the control samples, 2 mM probenecid was also added to the solution to inhibit the organic anion transport. After incubation, the samples were washed with ice cold PBS for 10 mins followed by an incubation with 8mM probenecid in PBS for 15 mins to arrest any transport. The functional assay was concluded by two PBS washes and samples were then embedded in 1.5% agarose for imaging.

Experiment Description	We have adapted the mouse kidney rudiment assay to generate renal organoids. 24 hours after pelleting 100,000 mouse kidney cells, organoids had formed in the PDMS dishes. For the PNA vital stain test we used kidney cells from wildtype mice and for the tracking time series we used cells from the Wt1tm1Nhsn strain, expressing GFP together with the transcription factor Wt1. One organoid was embedded in a hydrogel matrix (1.5% Agarose + 3% gelatine). In the microscope chamber, the hydrogel cylinder was extruded from the capillary so that the hydrogel column containing the organoid was located outside the capillary and immersed in medium (phenol red-free MEM + 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep, 3ug/ml PNA-rh) at 37oC and with 5% CO2. We recorded z stacks of the spheroids from multiple angles every 30 mins to record the location of the GFP expressing cells in three dimensions over time. There are three time series. These are available in the subfolders "Time PNA-rh vital", "Wt1-GFP PNA Time Series 1" and "Wt1-GFP PNA Time Series 2".  The time series data was processed in Fiji by opening the green channel only, binning in X and Y by a factor of two and converting it to 8 bit for processing in TrackMate (v.2.8.2) where we used the LoG (Laplacian of Gaussian) Detector and LAP (Linear Assignment Problem) Tracker options. Tracking data generated from the time series using the Track Mate plug in for Fiji is also provided in the time series data sets as "Nspots vs Time.txt", "Track statistics.txt", "Links in tracks statistics.txt" and "Spots in tracks statistics.txt". The data was analysed and plotted via the Matlab script provided as "TrackMateDataAnalysis.txt" in conjunction with the functions "NSpotsFunction.txt", "SpotsInTracksFunction.txt", "TrackStatisticsFunction.txt", "Violin.txt" and "violinplot.txt".

The organoids were cultured in this setup in a humidified incubator at 37oC and 5% CO2 overnight. "	"Organoids for live imaging were pre-stained in medium containing 30ug/ml PNA for 30 mins. Live imaging of organoids was performed on samples that were embedded in a hydrogel cylinder consisting of an agarose-gelatine mix inside a glass capillary. The hydrogels were prepared in sterile conditions. Prior to use, low melting agarose aliquots (3% in PBS, Sigma A9414) were melted in a heat block at 75oC before cooling down to 38oC. Gelatine aliquots (6% in PBS, Sigma G1890) were heated to 38oC and added to the agarose before embedding the organoids. The appropriate capillary sizes (size 1 ~0.68 mm, size 2 ~1 mm, size 3 ~1.5 mm, size 4 ~2.15 mm) were chosen for the sample to occupy between 1/3 and 2/3 of the agarose diameter. For culturing and imaging, the hydrogel cylinder was partially extruded so that the organoids were located outside the capillary. The imaging chamber was filled with ~12ml of phenol red-free MEM supplemented with 10% FCB, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 3ug/ml PNA-rh after sterilising with 70% ethanol followed by rinsing with distilled water, PBS and medium.  The glass capillaries were inserted into the imaging chamber of the microscope and the agarose column was extruded into the chamber filled with medium. Environmental conditions were set to 37oC and 5% CO2. The light sheet fluorescence microscope used was a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope, fitted with 10_ illumination objectives and an achromatic 20_ detection objective. The laser wavelengths used were 488 nm, 561 nm, and the laser intensity was kept to a minimum. Green fluorescent beads (1 um, Fluospheres (505/515), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA), were used as fiduciary markers. Z stacks from multiple angles were recorded every 30 minutes. "	"Data analysis was performed using the Zen analysis software (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) as 233 well as Fiji (ImageJ) [39]. Cell tracking was performed using the TrackMate plugin (v.2.8.2) 234 for Fiji [40] and three-dimensional visualisations of the data were generated using the 3D 235 Viewer (v.) plugin for Fiji [41]. The TrackMate [42] plugin for Fiji is a single particle tracking 236 tool that identifies spots, i.e. cells, in every frame and the trajectories of cells are 237 reconstructed by assigning an identity over these frames in the shape of a track. The 238 positional data and numerical features generated using TrackMate were further processed 239 and displayed using Matlab (R2014a, The Mathworks Inc., USA). Violin plots were 240 generated using a script obtained via https://github.com/bastibe/Violinplot-Matlab. The 241 Mann-Whitney U procedure for statistical testing was run in Matlab. Multiview reconstruction 242 was performed using the MultiView Reconstruction plugin in Fiji [43, 44]."
