Study Description	"Despite our rapidly growing knowledge about the human genome, we do not know all of the genes required for some of the most basic functions of life. To start to fill this gap we developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing by RNA interference, time-lapse microscopy and computational image processing. We carried out a genome-wide phenotypic profiling of each of the approximately 21,000 human protein-coding genes by two-day live imaging of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Phenotypes were scored quantitatively by computational image processing, which allowed us to identify hundreds of human genes involved in diverse biological functions including cell division, migration and survival. As part of the Mitocheck consortium, this study provides an in-depth analysis of cell division phenotypes and makes the entire high-content data set available as a resource to the community."

Quality Control Description	"Quality Control : Imaging data from the siRNA microarrays underwent a two-step quality control procedure based on automatic and manual inspection of the data, first on the level of the whole microarray and second on the level of individual siRNA spots to ensure stringent quality control criteria for technical quality and performance of positive and negative controls. Imaging data from each siRNA microarray was first checked manually in order to assure that the images were in focus, that the positive (siRNAs targeting INCENP, KIF11, COPB1) and negative (scrambled siRNA) controls behaved as expected, the cells looked healthy and that the image covered the spot region. Second, automatic quality control rules were applied: a slide was accepted for further evaluation if at least in 5 out of 7 (6 out of 8) negative controls no significant phenotype was detected automatically and the cell density was within reasonable limits (initial cell count between 15 and 200 and end cell count under 500) and if in addition 7 out of 11 positive controls showed the expected phenotype. After application of these quality control steps (both manual and automatic), data from 512 out of 674 imaged siRNA microarrays (~76 %) were kept for further evaluation. A second level of quality control concerned single siRNA spots in order to deal with local quality issues like floating dead cells or contamination by cells from neighbouring spots. These situations were detected automatically and checked manually, which led to the removal of 9382 (4.8 %) individual spots."

Protocol Description	As a high-content phenotypic assay we chose to monitor fluorescent chromosomes in a human cell line stably expressing core histone 2B tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP)	"Before production, the siRNA sequences were mapped (using BLAST) against the human genome using ENSEMBL genome database version 27. Only designs with 100% homology to the target gene, unique targeting in the genome and targeting all or most transcripts of the target gene were accepted for production. SiRNAs were redesigned if they failed these criteria. The silencer siRNAs were all chemically synthesized with a length of 21 bases and 2 bases overhang. A previously described protocol21 was used with minor modifications. The siRNA-gelatine transfection solution was prepared in 384 well plates (NalgeNunc) as described using a Microlab STAR (Hamilton) liquid handling robot with the following modifications. 5 _ l of siRNA solution (30 M), 3 _ l Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.4 M sucrose and 3.5 _ l Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were mixed and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. After incubation 7.25 l of 0.2% gelatine and 3.5x10-4% fibronectin (both Sigma-Aldrich) were added. In some experiments 0.5 _ l of a 40 _ M marker solution of Cy3 labelled DNA oligonucleotide was added together with the siRNA to judge transfection efficiency. These final siRNA transfection cocktails were then arrayed onto single-well chambered LabTek coverglass live cell imaging dishes (NalgeNunc) using a ChipWriter 1 chambered LabTek coverglass live cell imaging dishes (NalgeNunc) using a ChipWriter Compact Robot (Bio-Rad) with solid pins (Point Technologies) resulting in a spot volume of ~4 nl (containing ~5 ng siRNA) and a spot diameter of ~400 _ m and a spot to spot distance of 1125 _ m mirroring one 384 well plate per chamber. SiRNA microarrays were printed in 48 replicates then dried and stored in plastic boxes containing drying pearls orange (Fluka) at least over night. After drying, 1.1x105 HeLa-H2B-GFP cells were plated on the microarrays in a total volume of 1.5 ml culture medium (DMEM containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 10 % heat- inactivated foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin), and incubated for 16 h at 37oC and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected simply by growing on siRNA spots without further manipulation. After 16 h incubation the 1.5ml culture medium was removed and replaced by 4 ml preheated CO2-independent imaging medium (Invitrogen) (containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 _ g/ml streptomycin). In order to prevent any gas exchange the live cell microarrays were sealed using baysilone paste (Bayer) and kept for one additional hour in the pre-heated incubation chamber of an Olympus (IX-81; Olympus-Europe) microscope."	"Images were acquired with an automated epifluorescence microscope (IX-81; Olympus- Europe) as previously described1,22. Stabilized light sources (MT20, Olympus-Biosystems, Munich), firewire cameras (DB-H1, 1300x1024, Olympus-Biosystems) and an in house modified version of the “ScanR” software (now commercially available with all new developments from OSIS), EMBL environmental microscope incubator (EMBL, GP 106) as well as a new objective (Plan10x, NA 0.4; Olympus-Europe) and filter sets for GFP (Chroma Inc.) were implemented. An image based autofocusing routine22 was used to focus on the maximum number of interphase cells (scoring size, intensity, contrast) in a field of view. The focus z-coordinates of the transfected cell microarray were saved during the first round of imaging. The temperature stability of the incubated system allowed us to reuse the saved focus map for 48 hours without further autofocusing between the 30 min imaging intervals. As cells needed on average ~1 hour to go through mitosis, we obtained ~2 mitotic images per cell enabling us to detect delays  30 minutes, or a mitotic index change from 5 % to 7.5 %. Higher time resolution would increase the sensitivity to even more subtle delays but increase overall data volume. Illumination of the specimen was reduced to the minimum necessary for sufficient signal to noise ratio for automated phenotyping (see below) with exposure times of 18-50 ms (GFP). Data was compressed without loss (ZIP) on the fly, buffered locally on the microscope computers and then saved on a 5 TB network-attached-storage. Microscopes were connected via a 2 GBit/s network to the NAS to sustain uninterrupted data flow."	"To automatically score and annotate phenotypes in this large data set, we developed a computational pipeline2 (Fig. 1) extending previously established methods of morphology recognition by supervised machine learning3–6. In brief, after segmentation, about 200 quantitative features were extracted from each nucleus and used for classification into one of 16 morphological classes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movies 1–30) by a support vector machine classifier previously trained on a set of ~3,000 manually annotated nuclei (Supplementary Methods). This classifier automatically recognizes changes in nuclear morphology due to the cell cycle, cell death or other phenotypic changes with an overall accuracy of 87% (Supplementary Fig. 1) and allows us to convert each time-lapse movie into a phenotypic profile that quantifies the response to each siRNA (Fig. 1a). In addition, the position of each nucleus is tracked over time. Using stringent significance thresholds for each morphological class, nuclear mobility as well as proliferation rate, significant and reproducible (majority of three or more technical replicates) deviations caused by each siRNA are computed (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Methods).

Processed Data File Description	"This file provides details of the manual and automatic scores for the morphological classes examined at the level of the technical replicates of the siRNAs (i.e. at the well level) in the primary screen.  In addition it gives the reproducibility of the observation over the technical replicates of the siRNA, that is the number of times the class was observed manually, or the automated score was above the determined threshold. In the case of the manual observations some phenotypes were used only for training the classifier and not used further as indicated by a zero in the reproducibility count.  Phenotypes are given where the siRNA showed a phenotype more than once and in more than 50% of replicates.  Genes in the set of 1,249 potential mitotic hit genes from Supplementary Table 2 and 572 validated mitotic hit genes from Supplementary Table 4 are also indicated."

Quality Control Description	"Quality Control : Imaging data from the siRNA microarrays underwent a two-step quality control procedure based on automatic and manual inspection of the data, first on the level of the whole microarray and second on the level of individual siRNA spots to ensure stringent quality control criteria for technical quality and performance of positive and negative controls. Imaging data from each siRNA microarray was first checked manually in order to assure that the images were in focus, that the positive (siRNAs targeting INCENP, KIF11, COPB1) and negative (scrambled siRNA) controls behaved as expected, the cells looked healthy and that the image covered the spot region. Second, automatic quality control rules were applied: a slide was accepted for further evaluation if at least in 5 out of 7 (6 out of 8) negative controls no significant phenotype was detected automatically and the cell density was within reasonable limits (initial cell count between 15 and 200 and end cell count under 500) and if in addition 7 out of 11 positive controls showed the expected phenotype. After application of these quality control steps (both manual and automatic), data from 512 out of 674 imaged siRNA microarrays (~76 %) were kept for further evaluation. A second level of quality control concerned single siRNA spots in order to deal with local quality issues like floating dead cells or contamination by cells from neighbouring spots. These situations were detected automatically and checked manually, which led to the removal of 9382 (4.8 %) individual spots."

Protocol Description	As a high-content phenotypic assay we chose to monitor fluorescent chromosomes in a human cell line stably expressing core histone 2B tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP)	"Production of coated 384 well plates for live cell imaging (validation screen): The siRNA-gelatine transfection solution was prepared as described in the production of the transfected cell microarrays. 5  l of the siRNA transfection solution was mixed with 130  l of water using the manual 96 well liquid handling device Liquidator (Steinbrenner). 15  l of this water diluted siRNA transfection solution was pipetted in 384 well imaging plates (BD) and immediately lyophilized using the concentrator miVAC (Genevac). In total 8 replicates were produced and stored in plastic boxes containing drying pearls orange (Fluka) until usage. 750 HeLa-H2B-GFP cells / per well were seeded into the coated 384 well imaging plates (BD) using the cell seeding device Multidrop Combi (Thermo Scientific) and incubated for 16 h at 370 C and 5% CO2. After 16 h incubation the 50  l culture medium was removed and replaced by 100  l preheated CO2-independent imaging medium (Invitrogen) (containing 10 % heat- inactivated foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin). In order to prevent any gas exchange the 384 well plates were sealed using baysilone paste (Bayer) and kept for one additional hour in the pre-heated incubation chamber of an Olympus (IX-81; Olympus-Europe) microscope."	"Images were acquired with an automated epifluorescence microscope (IX-81; Olympus- Europe) as previously described1,22. Stabilized light sources (MT20, Olympus-Biosystems, Munich), firewire cameras (DB-H1, 1300x1024, Olympus-Biosystems) and an in house modified version of the “ScanR” software (now commercially available with all new developments from OSIS), EMBL environmental microscope incubator (EMBL, GP 106) as well as a new objective (Plan10x, NA 0.4; Olympus-Europe) and filter sets for GFP (Chroma Inc.) were implemented. An image based autofocusing routine22 was used to focus on the maximum number of interphase cells (scoring size, intensity, contrast) in a field of view. The focus z-coordinates of the transfected cell microarray were saved during the first round of imaging. The temperature stability of the incubated system allowed us to reuse the saved focus map for 48 hours without further autofocusing between the 30 min imaging intervals. As cells needed on average ~1 hour to go through mitosis, we obtained ~2 mitotic images per cell enabling us to detect delays  30 minutes, or a mitotic index change from 5 % to 7.5 %. Higher time resolution would increase the sensitivity to even more subtle delays but increase overall data volume. Illumination of the specimen was reduced to the minimum necessary for sufficient signal to noise ratio for automated phenotyping (see below) with exposure times of 18-50 ms (GFP). Data was compressed without loss (ZIP) on the fly, buffered locally on the microscope computers and then saved on a 5 TB network-attached-storage. Microscopes were connected via a 2 GBit/s network to the NAS to sustain uninterrupted data flow."	"To automatically score and annotate phenotypes in this large data set, we developed a computational pipeline2 (Fig. 1) extending previously established methods of morphology recognition by supervised machine learning3–6. In brief, after segmentation, about 200 quantitative features were extracted from each nucleus and used for classification into one of 16 morphological classes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movies 1–30) by a support vector machine classifier previously trained on a set of ~3,000 manually annotated nuclei (Supplementary Methods). This classifier automatically recognizes changes in nuclear morphology due to the cell cycle, cell death or other phenotypic changes with an overall accuracy of 87% (Supplementary Fig. 1) and allows us to convert each time-lapse movie into a phenotypic profile that quantifies the response to each siRNA (Fig. 1a). In addition, the position of each nucleus is tracked over time. Using stringent significance thresholds for each morphological class, nuclear mobility as well as proliferation rate, significant and reproducible (majority of three or more technical replicates) deviations caused by each siRNA are computed (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Methods).

Processed Data File Format	tab-delimited text																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														
Processed Data File Description	"This file provides details of the manual and automatic scores for the morphological classes examined at the level of the technical replicates of the siRNAs (i.e. at the well level) in the validation screen.  In addition it gives the reproducibility of the observation over the technical replicates of the siRNA, that is the number of times the class was observed manually, or the automated score was above the determined threshold. In the case of the manual observations some phenotypes were used only for training the classifier and not used further as indicated by a zero in the reproducibility count.  Phenotypes are given where the siRNA showed a phenotype more than once and in more than 50% of replicates.  Genes in the set of 1,249 potential mitotic hit genes from Supplementary Table 2 and 572 validated mitotic hit genes from Supplementary Table 4 are also indicated."
