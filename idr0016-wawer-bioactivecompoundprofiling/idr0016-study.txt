Study Title	Human U2OS cells - compound cell-painting experiment				
Study Type	high content screen				
Study Type Term Source REF	EFO				
Study Type Term Accession	EFO_0007550				
Study Description	Phenotypic profiling attempts to summarize multiparametric, feature-based analysis of cellular phenotypes of each sample so that similarities between profiles reflect similarities between samples. This image set provides a basis for testing image-based profiling methods wrt. to their ability to distinguish the effects of small molecules. The images are of U2OS cells treated with each of over 30,000 known bioactive compounds and labeled with six labels that characterize seven organelles (the cell-painting assay). Gustafsdottir et al. (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0080999) have developed a multiplex cytological profiling assay that "paints the cell" with as many fluorescent markers as possible without compromising our ability to extract rich, quantitative profiles in high throughput. The assay detects seven major cellular components. In a pilot screen of bioactive compounds, the assay detected a range of cellular phenotypes and it clustered compounds with similar annotated protein targets or chemical structure based on cytological profiles. The results demonstrate that the assay captures subtle patterns in the combination of morphological labels, thereby detecting the effects of chemical compounds even though their targets are not stained directly. This image-based assay provides an unbiased approach to characterize compound- and disease-associated cell states to support future probe discovery. Using the cell-painting assay, the Broad Institute has assembled a reference dataset of profiles for U2OS osteosarcoma cells treated with ~30,000 compounds. The compound collection includes DOS-derived compounds (20,000), as well as chemically diverse MLI compounds with biologically diverse performance identified through analysis of PubChem (10,000), and known bioactive compounds to serve as landmarks (2,500). The DOS compounds consist of structurally diverse and stereochemically rich compounds with structures distinct from the current MLSMR. The compound collection also includes 267 distinct compounds nominated by MLPCN Centers from projects for which the Centers would like to identify new chemical series with similar activities.

Study Version History	In August 2017 the 20 plates from the Broad Bioimaging Benchmark Collection dataset BBBC022 were moved to a separate screen, idr0036/screenA. At the same time 58 new plates, which had become available from the Cell Image Library (http://www.cellimagelibrary.org/pages/project_20269) after the original import to idr0016, were added to idr0016 and annotation was added to plate 25723 (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=plate-5104) which was previously unannotated. Protocols have been updated to reflect the materials and methods information in Wawer et al 2014.

Screen Sample Type	cell
Screen Description	Using the cell-painting assay developed by Gustafsdottir et al, 2013, the Broad Institute has assembled a reference dataset of profiles for U2OS osteosarcoma cells treated with ~30,000 compounds. The experiment consisted of 413 microtiter plates. Each plate has 384 wells. Each well has 6 fields of view; a very small fraction of the wells (0.002%) have a few sites missing. Each field was imaged in five channels (detection wavelengths), and each channel is stored as a separate, grayscale 16-bit TIFF image file.

Protocol Description	U_2 OS cells were plated at a density of 1500_2000 cells per well with 50 _L culture medium.	Cells were treated for 48 h at 37C. A 1 mM solution of Mitotracker in DMSO and a 1 mg/mL solution of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in distilled water were used to prepare a staining solution of 500nM Mitotracker and 60 _g/mL WGA in pre_warmed medium. After removal of 40 _L of media from the cells, 30 _L of the staining solution were added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37C. Cells were fixed for 20 min at RT with 10 _L paraformaldehyde and afterwards washed once with 70 _L HBSS. To permeabilize cells, 30 _L of a 0.1% solution of Triton X_100 in 1x HBSS were added, incubated for 10_20 min, and washed two times with 70 _L 1xHBSS. Concanavalin A was dissolved to 1 mg/mL in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate solution. Phalloidin was dissolved in 1.5 mL methanol per vial. Staining mix was prepared from 0.025 uL phalloidin/uL, 100 ug/mL Concanavalin, 5 ug/mL Hoechst, and 3uM SYTO staining solution in 1x HBSS 1% BSA. Aliquots of 30 uL staining mix were added to each well and incubated for 30 min. After staining, cells were washed three times with 70 uL 1xHBSS without final aspiration. Plates were thermally sealed at 171C (4 seconds).	We captured images on an ImageXpress Micro epifluorescent microscope. We recorded 9 sites per well at 20x magnification in 5 fluorescent channels, DAPI (387/447 nm), GFP (472/520 nm), Cy3 (531/593 nm), TexasRed (562/642 nm), Cy5 (628/692 nm). The first site of each well was used for laser_based auto_focus in the DAPI channel.	CellProfiler (18) software version 2.0.9925 was used to locate and segment cells and measure morphological features for each cell. We used pipelines described and provided by Gustafsdottir  et al. (17) to correct for uneven illumination and segment cells into nuclei and cytoplasm. Size, shape, texture, intensity statistics, and local density were measured for nuclei, cytoplasm, and entire cells. (17) Cell_morphology features were normalized by linearly scaling the 1st and 99th percentiles of the DMSO_control distributions to 0 and 1, respectively. Plate medians were subtracted from each profile and positional effects corrected with GeneData Screener Assay Analyzer. (15)
