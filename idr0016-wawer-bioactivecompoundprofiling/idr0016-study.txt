Study Description	"Phenotypic profiling attempts to summarize multiparametric, feature-based analysis of cellular phenotypes of each sample so that similarities between profiles reflect similarities between samples. This image set provides a basis for testing image-based profiling methods wrt. to their ability to distinguish the effects of small molecules. The images are of U2OS cells treated with each of over 30,000 known bioactive compounds and labeled with six labels that characterize seven organelles (the cell-painting assay). Gustafsdottir et al. (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0080999) have developed a multiplex cytological profiling assay that ""paints the cell"" with as many fluorescent markers as possible without compromising our ability to extract rich, quantitative profiles in high throughput. The assay detects seven major cellular components. In a pilot screen of bioactive compounds, the assay detected a range of cellular phenotypes and it clustered compounds with similar annotated protein targets or chemical structure based on cytological profiles. The results demonstrate that the assay captures subtle patterns in the combination of morphological labels, thereby detecting the effects of chemical compounds even though their targets are not stained directly. This image-based assay provides an unbiased approach to characterize compound- and disease-associated cell states to support future probe discovery. Using the cell-painting assay, the Broad Institute has assembled a reference dataset of profiles for U2OS osteosarcoma cells treated with ~30,000 compounds. The compound collection includes DOS-derived compounds (20,000), as well as chemically diverse MLI compounds with biologically diverse performance identified through analysis of PubChem (10,000), and known bioactive compounds to serve as landmarks (2,500). The DOS compounds consist of structurally diverse and stereochemically rich compounds with structures distinct from the current MLSMR. The compound collection also includes 267 distinct compounds nominated by MLPCN Centers from projects for which the Centers would like to identify new chemical series with similar activities.

Protocol Description	"U2OS cells (#HTB-96, ATCC) were plated at the density of 1500Ð2000 cells per well in 384-well imager quality black/clear plates (Aurora Biotechnologies/Nexus Biosystems) in 50ÊµL DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown for 24 h at 37¡C."	"Compounds were pin-transferred to cells using a CyBi-Well robot (CyBio, Inc.). Cells were treated for 48 h at 37¡C."	"The samples were stained as follows. Step 1: MitoTracker and Wheat Germ Agglutinin staining. MitoTracker Deep Red (#M22426, Invitrogen) was dissolved in DMSO to 1 mM. Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) Alexa594 conjugate (#W11262, Invitrogen) was dissolved in dH2O to 1Êmg/mL. A 500 nM MitoTracker, 60Êµg/mL WGA solution was prepared in prewarmed media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Media was removed from plates; residual volume was 10ÊµL in each well. 30ÊµL of staining solution was added to wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 ¡C. Step 2: Fixation.10 µL of 16% methanol-free paraformaldehyde (#15710-S, Electron Microscopy Services) was added to wells for a final concentration of 3.2%. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Wells were washed once with 70 µL 1xHBSS (#14065-056, Invitrogen). Step 3: Permeabilization. A 0.1% solution of Triton X-100 (T8787-100mL, Sigma) was prepared in 1x HBSS. 30 µL of the solution was added to the wells and incubated for 10Ð20 min. Wells were washed twice with 70 µL 1x HBSS. Step 4: Phalloidin, ConcanavalinA, Hoechst, and SYTO 14 staining. Concanavalin A Alexa488 conjugate (#C11252, Invitrogen) was dissolved to 1Êmg/mL in 0.1ÊM sodium bicarbonate (SH30033.01, HyClone), and Phalloidin Alexa594 conjugate (#A12381, Invitrogen) was dissolved in 1.5ÊmL methanol (67-56-1, BDH) per vial. A 0.025ÊµL phalloidin/µL solution, 100 µg/mL ConcanavalinA, 5Êµg/mL Hoechst33342 (#H3570, Invitrogen), and 3ÊµM SYTO14 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain (#S7576, Invitrogen) solution was prepared in 1x HBSS, 1% BSA. 30 µL of staining solution was added to wells and incubated for 30 min. Wells were washed three times with 70 µL 1xHBSS, no final aspiration. Plates were sealed with blue Remp thermal seal, at 171Ê¡C for 4Ês. Imaging: images were captured at 20x magnification in 5 fluorescent channels, DAPI (387/447 nm), GFP (472/520 nm), Cy3 (531/593 nm), TexasRed (562/642 nm), Cy5 (628/692 nm) on an ImageXpress Micro epifluorescent microscope (Molecular Devices), 9 sites per well, with laser based autofocus in the DAPI channel, first site of each well. Image analysis: Version 2.0.9925 of the image-analysis software CellProfiler [6] was used to locate and segment the cells and measure many features of each cell (Table S2) using the pipelines provided (Text S1). After correcting for uneven illumination, the pipeline identifies the nuclei from the DAPI channel and uses the nuclei as seeds to help a segmentation algorithm identify the cytoplasm[20,21]. The pipeline measure size, shape, texture, intensity statistics, and local density of the nuclei, cytoplasms, and entire cells. "	"Annotation of the pilot project set. We used annotations that have previously been collected and curated over the course of several projects. Many of the annotations have been deposited into ChemBank [22], but the annotation work has continued after ChemBank became static. The annotations we used are included as supplementary data. The annotations covered 649 of the 1600 compounds in the experiment (Table S6). Some annotations were from the Gene Ontology [23] (including GOMF, GOBP, and GOCC). Others were medical subject headings (MeSH) or product use/class fields from the compoundsÕ material safety data sheets. There were also a small number of protein targets (Entrez GeneIDs) among the annotations. The annotation terms had been Òslimmed,Ó replacing excessively detailed terms with more general terms that give a broader overview. The GO annotations were slimmed using GO slim [23], whereas MeSH and product use/class terms were slimmed by manual inspection. The protein targets were slimmed by assigning the appropriate GOMF, then applying GO slim. Finding term-enriched clusters. We identified clusters and scored them for enrichment for annotation terms as follows. 1. 1. Computed a profile for each of the 7680 samples (20 plates with 384 wells per plate) by averaging each CellProfiler-generated feature across the cells in the well. Averaging has been effective for profiling even though it does not explicitly model heterogeneity among cells [4,10]. The entire CellProfiler feature set was used for the analysis; while feature reduction techniques may result in incremental improvements in performance, we chose to transform the data as little as possible in order to focus the evaluation on the assay itself rather than advanced data-analysis methods. For the same reason, we also chose well-known and transparent methods for the subsequent steps of the analysis. 2. 2. Aggregated the 7680 per-sample profiles into 1601 per-compound profiles by computing the element-wise median. The 1601 per-compound profiles include the median mock profile, i.e., the median profile of all DMSO-treated samples. 3. 3. Excluded compounds that were inactive in the assay. Compounds were deemed to be active if their profilesÕ Euclidean distance to the median mock profile was above a cutoff. The cutoff was the 95th percentile of the distances from the mock-treated wells to the median mock profile. Of the 1600 compounds, 203 (13%) were active. 4. 4. Excluded compounds that were unannotated. Of the 203 active compounds, 75 were annotated by one or more of 96 slimmed terms (Table S7). 5. 5. Performed hierarchical clustering of the compound profiles of the 75 compounds that were active and annotated, using the cosine distance and single linkage. 6. 6. Assessed whether each possible cluster is enriched by each annotation term (Table S8). There were 74 possible clusters, one for each non-leaf subtree of the dendrogram produced by the hierarchical clustering. The assessment was by permutation testing: we measured the fraction of random clusters of the same size that had at least the same number of compounds annotated with the term in question. When constructing random clusters for permutation testing, the cluster members were drawn from a uniform distribution over the compounds. It was not necessary to correct for multiple testing because the fractions were only used for ranking and not interpreted as p-values. Enrichment in GO terms has also recently been used to validate clusters of profiles generated from HTS experiments [24]. Table S8 shows the clusters ranked by permutation-testing score, i.e., the fraction of random clusters that had at least the same number of compounds annotated with the term in question. For each cluster, it shows the number of compounds in the cluster, the number of times the enriched term occurs in the cluster, and the number of times the enriched term occurs in the entire dataset. For each compound in the cluster, the table shows whether the compound has the enriched term, as well as the compoundÕs name and Broad ID (internal identifier from our compound-management department). Reproducibility. We provide (Text S1) the complete image set, the CellProfiler pipelines used to identify and measure the cells, the database of cellular features, and the source code for the programs that analyze the features and produce the figures and tables in this article."													
																	
# Phenotypes																	
Phenotype Name	cellular response to chemical stimulus	decreased cell numbers															
Phenotype Description	A profile was computed for the response to each compound in the 20 plates in the pilot screen (Gustafsdottir et al 2013). A profile was computed for each of the 7680 samples (20 plates with 384 wells per plate) by averaging each CellProfiler-generated feature across the cells in the well. Then the 7680 per-sample profiles were aggregated into 1601 per-compound profiles by computing the element-wise median. Compounds were deemed to be active if their profilesÕ Euclidean distance to the median mock profile was above a cutoff. The cutoff was the 95th percentile of the distances from the mock-treated wells to the median mock profile	"For each of the compounds that were both active and annotated in the 20 plates in the pilot screen (Gustafsdottir et al 2013), the number of cells were counted in each well and the median cell count across the compoundÕs four replicate wells was computed. Compounds with a median cell count below 88 (three standard deviations below the mean) were considered as cytotoxic. "
