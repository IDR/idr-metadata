Study Title	High-Content Phenotypic Profiling of Drug Response Signatures across Distinct Cancer Cells					
Study Type	high content screen					
Study Type Term Source REF	EFO					
Study Type Term Accession	EFO_0007550					
Study Description	The application of high-content imaging in conjunction with multivariate clustering techniques has recently shown value in the confirmation of cellular activity and further characterization of drug mode of action following pharmacologic perturbation. However, such practical examples of phenotypic profiling of drug response published to date have largely been restricted to cell lines and phenotypic response markers that are amenable to basic cellular imaging. As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context.  Note: The images in idr0035/screenA were generated by Caie et al, 2010 and are from MCF7 wild-type cells only.  They were obtained from the Broad BioImage Benchmark Collection image set BBBC021v1. (https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC021/) submitted by Ljosa et al, 2013.  The Mechanism of Action ground truth data comes from Ljosa et al, 2013.

Comment[IDR Screen Name]	idr0035-caie-drugresponse/screenA	
Screen Sample Type	cell
Screen Description	The images are of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated for 24 h with a collection of 113 small molecules at eight concentrations. The cells were fixed, labeled for DNA, F-actin, and B-tubulin, and imaged by fluorescent microscopy as described [Caie et al. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, 2010]. Note: The images in idr0035/screenA were generated by Caie et al, 2010 and are from MCF7 wild-type cells only.  They were obtained from the Broad BioImage Benchmark Collection image set BBBC021v1 (https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC021/) submitted by Ljosa et al, 2013.

Protocol Description	The cell line MCF7-wt (breast cancer expressing wild-type p53) were subcultured in the following media preparations: RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% GlutaMAX (200 mmol/L), and 900 ug/mL G418. All media and supplements were supplied by Sigma. All cells were maintained at 37oC, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. For high-content assays, cells were resuspended in Accutase (Sigma) and plated on collagen-coated black 96-well clear bottom plates (Becton Dickinson) using a WellMate-fine bore (Matrix) at 5,000 cells per well in 95 uL media. These plates were subsequently cultured at 37oC, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity for 24 hours before compound addition. All cell lines were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.	All compounds were prepared and titrated as an eight point half-log dose response in a 96-well microtiter plate in 100% DMSO at 1,000x final drug concentration. Highest concentrations for each compound were selected from previously published data indicating activity in cell-based assays. Compound dilutions were prepared using a Tecan-automated dispensing system. Using a Biomek Fx-automated dispensing system, 5 uL from the compound dilution plate were dispensed into the intermediate plate containing 250 uL of cell culture media and mixed before transfer of 5 uL to each cell plate. Cell plates were incubated with the compound and 0.1% DMSO control at 37oC, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity for 24 and 48 hours.	All immunostaining procedures were done at room temperature in 96-well plates. All volumes are 100 uL unless otherwise stated. Cells were fixed following direct addition of 100 uL 8% paraformaldehyde in PBS to cells (final concentration, 4%) and were incubated for 20 minutes. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% Triton X100) for 30 minutes. Primary antibody solution diluted in blocking buffer (1:500; mouse anti-B-tubulin IgG1, Sigma T5293) was added at 40 uL per well and incubated for 1 hour. Cells were washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated with blocking buffer for 30 minutes. Secondary antibody solution of (40 uL) Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L; Molecular probes A21202; diluted at 1:500), Phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular probes A12380; diluted 1:500), and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma D8417) diluted at 1:250 in blocking buffer was incubated with cells for 45 minutes in the dark. Cells were washed three times with PBS. Deep red HCS cell mask (Molecular probes, H34560) diluted at 1:120,000 was added and incubated for 10 minutes. Cell were washed twice with PBS. Plates were sealed with black plate sealers before imaging.All images were acquired on the automated ImageXpress 5000A high-content imaging platform (Molecular Devices) using a x20 PanFluor ELWD Ph1 DM objective and a 16-bit camera binning resolution of 1. Four separate fields of view per well were acquired using laser-based autofocus parameters optimized for cell plates and cell type.
