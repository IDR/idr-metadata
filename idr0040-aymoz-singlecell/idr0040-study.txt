Study Description	"During development, morphogens provide extracellular cues allowing cells to select a specific fate by inducing complex transcriptional programs. The mating pathway in budding yeast offers simplified settings to understand this process. Pheromone secreted by the mating partner triggers the activity of a MAPK pathway, which results in the expression of hundreds of genes. Using a dynamic expression reporter, we quantified the kinetics of gene expression in single cells upon exogenous pheromone stimulation and in the physiological context of mating. In both conditions, we observed striking differences in the timing of induction of mating-responsive promoters. Biochemical analyses and generation of synthetic promoter variants demonstrated how the interplay between transcription factor binding and nucleosomes contribute to determine the kinetics of transcription in a simplified cell-fate decision system.

Protocol Description	"The cells were grown overnight in selective synthetic medium to saturation (YNB:CYN3801, CSM:DCS0031, ForMedium). They were diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in the morning and grown for 4 hours before starting the experiment." "All the time-lapse experiments were performed in well slides, for which selected wells of 96-well plates (MGB096-1-2LG, Matrical Bioscience) were coated with filtered solution of Concanavalin A in H2O (0.5 mg/ml, C2010-250MG, Sigma- Aldrich) for 30 minutes, rinsed with H2O and dried for at least ten hours. Before the experiments, the cells were diluted to an OD600 of 0.04, briefly sonicated, and 200μL of cell suspension were added to a well. Imaging was started 30 minutes later, so as to let the cells settle to the bottom to the well. To stimulate the cells, 100 μL of a 3 μM solution of synthetic exogenous α-factor (gift from M. Peter’s lab.) was added in the well before the 4th timepoint to reach a final 1 μM concentration of pheromone." "Images were acquired on a fully automated inverted epi-fluorescence microscope (Ti-Eclipse, Nikon) controlled by Micro-Manager (Edelstein et al, 2010) and placed in an incubation chamber set at 30°C, with a 40X oil objective and appropriate excitation and emission filters. The excitation was provided by a solid-state light source (SpectraX, Lumencor). The images were recorded with a sCMOS camera (Flash4.0, Hamamatsu). A motorized XY-stage allowed recording multiple fields of view at every time point, typically 5 positions per well. CFP (50ms), RFP (300ms) and YFP (300ms) and 2 bright-field (10ms) images were recorded at time intervals of 5 minutes." "Time-lapse movies were analyzed with the YeastQuant platform (Pelet et al, 2012). Briefly, the nuclei of the cells were segmented by thresholding of the CFP images. The contour of the cell around each nucleus was detected using two bright-field images. The cytoplasm object was obtained by removing the nucleus object expanded by two pixels from the cell object.
